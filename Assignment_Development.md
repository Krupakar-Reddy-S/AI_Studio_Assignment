# AI Development Take-Home Project

We're excited to see how you approach real-world AI development challenges.

## üìã Your Assignment Options

Please choose *at least* **ONE** of the following assignments that best showcases your skills:

<aside>
üí°

### Option 1: MCP Server for API Integration üîå

</aside>

Build a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that bridges Claude/LLMs with a real-world API of your choice. MCP is Anthropic's new open standard that's revolutionizing how AI applications connect to external data sources and tools‚Äîthink "USB-C for AI." Your server will act as a standardized bridge, allowing any MCP-compatible AI application to seamlessly interact with your chosen API without custom integration work.

**What you'll build:** A lightweight server that exposes API capabilities (tools, resources, and prompts) through the MCP protocol. Popular choices include financial APIs (Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance), weather services (OpenWeatherMap), news APIs (NewsAPI), or productivity tools (GitHub, Notion, Slack).

- **Deliverables:** GitHub repo, comprehensive README, demo video, technical design decisions document
- **Focus:** Clean, maintainable code, useful tools, robust error handling, proper MCP protocol implementation
- **Bonus points:** Multi-API support, caching strategies, rate limiting, comprehensive logging
- **Perfect for:** Developers who love system integration and want to contribute to the emerging MCP ecosystem

### Option 2: AI-Powered Voice Journaling App üéôÔ∏è

</aside>

Create a voice-first journaling experience where users speak their thoughts and an AI companion helps them reflect, process emotions, and gain insights through natural conversation. This isn't just transcription‚Äîit's an intelligent dialogue partner that asks thoughtful follow-up questions, identifies patterns, and helps users explore their thoughts more deeply.

**What you'll build:** A web application with voice recording, real-time transcription (using Whisper), conversational AI responses, and a clean interface for reviewing past entries and insights.

- **Deliverables:** Deployed web app (Vercel/Netlify), GitHub repo, demo video showcasing the conversation flow, architecture diagram
- **Focus:** Intuitive UX/UI design, thoughtful AI conversation prompts, emotional intelligence in responses, clean technical implementation
- **Bonus features:** Daily/weekly summary insights, mood tracking over time, generated reflection images with DALL-E, export to PDF
- **Perfect for:** Developers interested in AI psychology, conversational UX, and building genuinely helpful personal tools

### Option 3: Meeting Transcription Tool üìù

</aside>

Build a comprehensive meeting transcription solution that goes beyond simple speech-to-text. Your tool will capture audio, provide accurate transcriptions, identify key discussion points, extract action items, and generate executive summaries‚Äîtransforming chaotic meeting recordings into organized, actionable documentation.

**What you'll build:** A robust application that handles audio upload/recording, processes it through Whisper for transcription, uses LLMs for intelligent analysis, and outputs structured meeting documentation in multiple formats.

- **Deliverables:** Working application (web or desktop), sample processed meeting outputs, integration examples/documentation, performance benchmarks
- **Focus:** Transcription accuracy, actionable insight extraction, multiple export formats (PDF, Markdown, JSON), clean data processing pipeline
- **Bonus features:** Speaker diarization (who said what), automatic meeting type detection, integration with calendar tools, real-time processing
- **Perfect for:** Developers who want to solve real workplace problems and work with audio processing, NLP, and document generation

### Option 4: Prompt Engineering Playground üß™

</aside>

Create an advanced prompt testing and optimization environment‚Äîessentially "Postman for prompts." This tool will help developers systematically test, version, and analyze prompt performance across different models, making prompt engineering more scientific and less guesswork.

**What you'll build:** A sophisticated web application where users can create, test, and compare prompts across multiple LLM providers, track performance metrics, run A/B tests, and manage prompt libraries with version control.

- **Deliverables:** Functional playground application, curated sample prompt library, analytics dashboard with meaningful metrics, cost tracking features
- **Focus:** Multi-LLM support (OpenAI, Anthropic, others), robust A/B testing framework, cost tracking and optimization, prompt versioning system
- **Advanced features:** Automated prompt optimization suggestions, batch testing capabilities, team collaboration features, API for programmatic access
- **Perfect for:** Developers passionate about developer tools, data visualization, and systematic optimization‚Äîwho want to build something the entire AI community will use

## üõ†Ô∏è AI-Native Development Toolkit

### Suggested Tools:

- **Coding:** Windsurf/Cursor/Copilot
- **Planning:** Claude/ChatGPT/Gemini
- **Backend/Hosting:** Supabase for database, Netlify, Railway for hosting
- **Communication:** Loom for demos, any AI for professional emails optionally

## üéØ What We're Evaluating

We're looking for strong technical implementation, smart use of AI tools (including knowing when NOT to use them), and product thinking that goes beyond the requirements. Show us your workflow in the demo video ‚Äì how you plan, which tools you use and why, and your thought process throughout the project. The best submissions demonstrate both AI fluency and solid engineering fundamentals.

## üí° Pro Tips for Success

### ‚úÖ DO:

- Show your prompts and AI interactions
- Document your workflow and decisions

### ‚ùå DON'T:

- Submit AI code without understanding it
- Skip testing "because AI wrote it"

## üìä Submission Requirements

1. **GitHub Repository** (public or add us as collaborators)
2. **Demo Video** (include your workflow, tools used, and thought process)
3. **Brief Write-up** including:
    - AI tools used and why
    - Interesting challenges faced
    - What you'd improve with more time
