# AI Site Visit System Architecture

## **The Problem**

An architecture firm's site engineers record audio notes during visits but struggle to create complete, actionable reports. Critical details get missed, action items are unclear, and there's no systematic tracking across multiple visits.

**Your mission:** Design (not code) an AI-powered system that transforms audio recordings + floor plans into structured reports and data. Focus on architecture, strategy, and system thinking - not implementation.

## **What You Need to Design**

### **1. System Architecture (Main Focus)**

- **Architecture diagram** showing components and data flow
- **Technology stack** with AI tool selections and rationale
- **Core API endpoints** and data schemas
- **Database design** with relationships and sample data

### **2. AI Processing Strategy**

- How you'll handle **audio transcription + analysis**
- Approach for **cross-referencing with floor plans**
- **Key prompts** for data extraction
- **Error handling** when AI fails

### **3. User Interface Concepts**

- **Mobile interface** for site engineers to upload audio
- **Dashboard** for office team to review reports
- Simple **wireframes or descriptions**

## **Deliverables**

1. **System Design Document** (3-4 pages)
    - Architecture diagram and tech stack
    - API design and database schema
    - AI workflow explanation
2. **Sample Database** (Google Sheets or SQL)
    - Schema with sample data from provided materials
    - Show how audio content becomes structured data
3. **Brief Implementation Plan** (1 page)
    - 3-phase development roadmap
    - Key risks and success metrics

## **Evaluation Focus**

- **AI-Native Thinking:** Creative use of AI tools throughout system
- **System Design:** Scalable architecture and solid database design
- **Business Understanding:** Solving the real problem effectively
- **Clear Communication:** Professional presentation of ideas

## **What We Want to See**

Show us how you think through AI-powered system design. We're looking for strategic thinking, not perfect implementation details, but your thought behind the system design. Focus on **how AI makes this system better** than traditional approaches, and also mention the **issues that** **AI introduces and their solutions**.
