# Context Document

## About Our Firm

We're a residential architecture firm managing 100+ concurrent projects, ranging from home renovations to new construction. Projects typically span 6-18 months with weekly site visits during active construction phases.

## Current Site Visit Process

1. Site Engineer visits project weekly
2. Records audio notes while inspecting rooms
3. Makes on-site decisions with clients/contractors
4. Creates written report (usually incomplete)
5. Communicates issues to office team

## Key Challenges We Face

- Engineers capture <25% of issues in reports
- Action items get lost or assigned unclearly
- No systematic tracking across multiple visits
- Office team lacks full context for follow-up
- Ends up into delayed timelines and blame games

## What Good Reports Should Enable

- Complete documentation of site status
- Clear action items with deadlines
- Effective communication between all parties
- Progress tracking across visits
