# Planning for Participant Recruitment and Disk Resource Management

## Purpose
To discuss strategies for recruiting appropriate participants for speech-related recordings and to address the current status and process of managing disk storage resources for meetings and broadcasts.

## Key Takeaways
- Priority is to bring participants onsite rather than traveling with equipment due to complexity and equipment safety.
- Offering free lunch after participation is a good incentive, but participants must complete required tasks (digits) to receive it.
- Volunteers from Haas Business School are a potential resource, but their continuing interest must be confirmed.
- Aiming to recruit a diverse group of participants beyond linguists and engineers for wider sampling.
- Proposal to give participants a CD recording of their speech as a novelty and incentive, but distribution must comply with transcript screening and legal restrictions.
- Disk archiving is ongoing to free up storage space; completing archiving of broadcast news files will free 10 GB to record approximately five more meetings.
- Archiving involves copying and cloning data (two copies: on-site and off-site), which is time-consuming but necessary for backup and space management.
- P files from broadcast news are regeneratable and can be deleted after archiving to free space.

## Detailed Summary

### Participant Recruitment and Incentives
- Discussed complexities preventing offsite recording due to equipment issues; preference to bring people onsite.
- Room availability favors onsite sessions since the space is underused.
- Free lunch proposed as an incentive after tasks completion (digits) to ensure participation.
- Concern to target the right group to avoid wasting time and resources.
- Volunteers from Haas Business School considered but their continued willingness uncertain.
- Emphasis on diversifying participant pool beyond linguists and engineers to avoid sampling bias.
- The idea to give participants an audio CD of their speech recording as a novelty and to build engagement towards future technology use.
- CD distribution should follow transcript clearance and legal constraints to prevent misuse.

### Disk Resources and Archiving Status
- Current disk space is limited but archiving efforts are freeing up space gradually.
- P files from broadcast news are being archived, a process that takes many hours due to copying and cloning.
- Archiving process involves copying data to tape storage within Abbott facility and deleting original files.
- Completion of archiving will free approximately 10 GB, enough to record five additional meetings.
- Two copies of archived data are maintained for safety: one off-site and one on-site.
- The broadcast news P files are regeneratable so deleting them post-archiving is acceptable.
- Acknowledged that retrieving archived data back from tapes is slower than copying data to tape.

## Action Items

### Follow up with Haas Business School volunteers
**Assignee:** Meeting organizer (possibly the speaker)
**Description:** Send an email to confirm the willingness of Haas Business School volunteers to participate in the recordings, informing them about the free lunch incentive.
